### Notes
- Removing the comment `#define MAC` will make the program use the Mac key <kbd>âŒ˜</kbd> instead of the Windows/Linux <kbd>LEFT CTRL</kbd>. I don't have a MAC so those functions are untested for the MAC.
- Instead of the ALT on MAC is used the <kbd>OPTION</kbd> button. I didn't found this button in the library, maybe the is the same of ALT, can anyone let me know?
- Every click on the encoder button alternate between Zoom Fit (adapt image to the monitor) and Zoom 100% (real dimensions). After a zoom command the first press of encoder will be resetted to Zoom fit (flag `zoomfit`).
