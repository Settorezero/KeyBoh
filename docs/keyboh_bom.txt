ENCODER			rotary encoder
THUMBSTICK		PS2-like analog thumbstick
H1				male pinheader 10pin							Arduino header - solder on top
H2				male pinheader 8pin								Arduino header - solder on top
H3				male pinheader 8pin 							Arduino header - solder on top
H4				male pinheader 6pin 							Arduino header - solder on top
UART			male pinheader right angle 4pin                 Optional
I2C				male pinheader right angle 4pin                 Optional
EXT1			male pinheader right angle 3pin                 Optional

* Those 2 resistors are used only in the case you use an Arduino Compatible board running at 3.3V and the device on UART connector
works at 5V, in that case two resistors forms a voltage divider that consent to receive a 3.3V signal on RX pin of Arduino.
If you use a 3.3V Arduino Leonardo or other device, you must also change the SJ1 solder jumper setting, and eventually disconnect
also the SJ2, SJ3 and SJ4 solder jumpers or simply don't use the 5V pin if not needed
