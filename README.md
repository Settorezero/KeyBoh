# KeyBoh

![image](./media/keyboh_16_9.jpg)

KeyBoh is an Arduino Leonardo shield for making customizable USB keyboards. We love to use the [NicoHood HID Project library](https://github.com/NicoHood/HID) for interfacing the whole thing to a Computer.

## Buy a PCB  
Making the PCB on PCBWay will support our work!
You need to subscribe to PCBWay first: you can do it using [this invite link](https://www.pcbway.com/setinvite.aspx?inviteid=355653&from=settorezero2020).  
Then you can let you make the [PCB on PCBWay using from the shared project page](https://www.pcbway.com/project/shareproject/KeyBoh_Shield.html)

## Print it by yourself!
In the [STL folder](./stl) are located all parts you can 3Dprint by yourself. 

## Code examples
See in the [Arduino folder](./arduino) for code examples.
We're currently working to a multi-predefined configurable keyset for various applications, so stay tuned.
