KeyBoh is an Arduino Leonardo shield for making customizable USB keyboards. We love to use the [NicoHood HID Project library](https://github.com/NicoHood/HID) for interfacing the whole thing to a Computer.

## Buy a PCB  
Making the PCB on PCBWay will support my work, but you need to subscribe to PCBWay first: you can do it using [my invite link](https://www.pcbway.com/setinvite.aspx?inviteid=355653&from=settorezero2020).  
The you can let you make the [PCB on PCBWay](https://www.pcbway.com/project/shareproject/KeyBoh_Shield.html)
